====================================================

Based on the vlasvik/gettext-tools-windows, but patched additionally msgfmt for creation of java classes as discussed here:

GNU gettext tools for Windows
=============================

This is an unofficial build of *GNU gettext* tools for Windows. The repository
contains build scripts, but there are also up-to-date binaries published at
https://github.com/vslavik/gettext-tools-windows/releases, as well as a NuGet
package.

It is a spin-off project from my translations editor Poedit: https://poedit.net


How to build it
---------------

The easiest way to use these tools is to just download the binaries or use the
`Gettext.Tools` [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Gettext.Tools/).

If you prefer to build it yourself, it's simple enough:

1. You need to have a recent version of MSYS2 and MinGW-w64 installed from
   https://www.msys2.org; run all subsequent commands within a MinGW 32 shell.
2. Install required packages:
    ```
    pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-gcc automake autoconf pkg-config make zip patch tar
    ```
3. Run `make dist` or `make archive` to build everything.

Good luck, building GNU gettext on MinGW tends to break once in a while due to
MinGW or gettext or gnulib changes (hence this project...).
